Summary: An experience report on the Koka programming language.

## Background

After repeatedly discovering that my Good Ideas for [the programming language I wish I were writing](/articles/lang.html) were actually reinventions of things that Koka is already doing, I decided to try using it for a bit.

[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) is a functional programming language designed around *effects*, a type kind (in the formal sense of "kind") which allows functions to describe the kinds of side effects they have.
Despite being functional, mutability is a first-class concept; functions that write to or read from variables they're given have these operations mentioned in their effects.
Other effects might describe functions which might not terminate, or functions that can raise exceptions, or even programmer-defined nonlinear control flow.

I have some prior experience with older functional programming languages, but I'm definitely not an expert.
I've never used Haskell "in production," and while I do try to read some type theory research, most of it is still beyond me.
Despite that, Koka has been surprisingly accessible to me as a primarily Go programmer.

That said, Koka is very much an in-progress research language.
I've encountered a lot of questions that I didn't find answered in documentation, and certainly not in the Koka book.
(Probably more than a few are answered, just not where I've looked so far.)
I'm at the point where I want to start collecting those questions as a guide to places that could be improved.

This report will equally cover experiences with the language itself and with the tooling installed in VS Code by the Koka extension, including the language server.
I'll leave sorting out the details of what applies to which to those more expert.

For context, the things I've tried writing so far have been:
- An interpreter for the Io programming language.
	I made almost no progress on this one, for a number of reasons.
- A JSON parser using the std/text/parse parser combinator library.
	This one I mostly finished.
	It was while trying to answer questions about this that I found the [koka-community](https://github.com/koka-community) GitHub organization, which helped me find answers to many other questions.
- A generic hashmap, since I couldn't find one at the time (since spotted in a [koka-community/std PR](https://github.com/koka-community/std/pull/3)) and it's a crucial component of an Io interpreter.
	Finished aside from some important helpers.

The only materials I used to learn Koka before writing code were [the book](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html) and the first half or so of each of the [row-polymorphic effects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2061) and [Perceus](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/11/perceus-tr-v1.pdf) papers.


## Syntax


### Inconvenciences

VS Code's syntax highlighting always treats `<` and `>` as brackets, even when they're part of `<-` and `->` tokens.
That leaves them almost always mismatched, which is filling my hashmap module with red marks, even though it has no errors.

Having both `val` and `value` as keywords makes writing a generic container a bit awkward.
(Maybe `value` isn't actually a reserved word, though?)
Even though Koka lets me use `v` as both a type name and a variable name, I still prefer to keep them separate.

Related: it is *very cool* that type and variable namespaces are separated syntactically.
Also very cool that type parameters can be implicit as a result.


### `abstract`

What exactly does the `abstract` annotation on types do?
I saw a description of itâ€¦ somewhere, but now I can't find it.
The grammar indicates that it's mutually exclusive with the `pub` visibility modifier, so is it also a visibility modifier?
I seem to recall that it has something to do with supressing automatically generated functions relating to a type definition.


### Killing the parser

I tried writing a nested loop over a vector of lists of pairs as the following:

```
pub fun foreach(hm: hmap<k, v>, action: (k, v) -> e ()): e ()
  with bu <- hm.buckets.foreach
  with (key, el) <- bu.foreach
  action(key, el)
```

Apparently this was explosive.
The language server stopped reporting any errors at all, even obvious syntax errors.
If I load the module in the interpreter like this, I get a stack trace that doesn't mention my code anywhere:

```
parse   : c:/Users/zephyr/Documents/mykk/hmap/hmap.kk
check   : hmap
^
hmap(1, 1): internal error: Syntax.Parse.parameter: unexpected function expression in parameter match transform
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at src\Common\Failure.hs:46:12 in koka-3.1.1-4KWDIhobz6XJ1Dhpw9I5uN:Common.Failure
  raise, called at src\Common\Failure.hs:32:5 in koka-3.1.1-4KWDIhobz6XJ1Dhpw9I5uN:Common.Failure
  failure, called at src\Syntax\Parse.hs:1443:37 in koka-3.1.1-4KWDIhobz6XJ1Dhpw9I5uN:Syntax.Parse
```

It seems that the problem is that patterns can't appear to the left of `<-`.
That's fine by itself.
The experiential complaint is that the language server silently went dark as a result.
It'd be nice if it could at least inform me that it couldn't parse the module due to an internal error, ideally with a line number.


### Caret

A number of functions in std have parameters with names prefixed by `^`.
In at least one case, it's composed with `?` for an implicit parameter.

I have no idea what `^` means.
Sometimes the documentation on functions bearing it contains what appear to be error messages, though!

More broadly, there seems to be a small syntax for doc comments.
Info on that would be great.
And also info on the documentation system in general; I actually quite like the std docs site.


## Semantics


### Partial type checking

Probably the single thing that would most improve my experience with Koka would be partial type checking in the language server.
As it is, type information in VS Code reflects the last time your module was entirely free of errors.
That means that, in general, you can't check the types of values you're working with while writing a new function.


### Corecursion

As I mentioned at the start, I'm not strongly versed in type theory.
I don't really understand what a coinductive type is.
The only example I have ever seen is "the type of possibly infinite streams," and Koka continues that trend.

What else can a cotype represent?
I believe inductive types interact nicely with divergence checking; how do cotypes interact with effect inference?
Why would I choose cotypes over fully recursive types?


### Divergence checking

I'm not sure where to find a formal description of the divergence checking algorithm.
Since totality makes the most general API, understanding the decisions that can prevent it can lead to better designs.

If I were to guess at the div inference algorithm now, it would be something like,
"A recursive function is divergent unless at least one parameter is inductive and at least one inductive argument is structurally reduced by pattern matching."
I'm certain that's incomplete, though.
Immediately, it doesn't account for closures passed as argument which might dynamically produce recursion.


### Return

This is probably something I could resolve myself with a reread of the Koka book, but knowing that blocks are syntactic sugar for closures actually makes `return` control flow a bit confusing for me.
A couple times now, I have written foreaches or mappings that could have used an early return to simplify the body, but since I'm a bit unclear on that interaction, I chose more verbose forms instead.


### Conditional effects

There are situations where a "hash" function [should be non-deterministic](https://research.swtch.com/randhash).
In Koka, non-determinism is explicitly tracked with the `ndet` effect.
So, if I want my hashmap to use a non-deterministic hash function for floating-point keys, I have to mark *every* operation on the hashmap ndet, for every type.
Alternatively, I could make the effects polymorphic, but then they can introduce any effects, when really I just want "either ndet or total."

I don't think there's a way to express this kind of constraint.
Moreover, I think that's fine.
Allowing conditional effects sounds like an easy way to bump up the complexity class of type inference.
It just happens to be inconvenient for this particular case.

I think the correct solution in this case is to duplicate the hashmap methods for ndet versions.
If float64's hash function is itself ndet, then it won't work in the versions that expect total hashes.


### Extensible data types

One of the challenges I encountered when starting an Io interpreter was the representation of primitive data.
Io is an "everything is an object" language, with many objects carrying a primitive value representing anything from a number to a list to a file descriptor.
In proper Io, it's also possible to load extensions from shared libraries that add new primitive types dynamically.

I'd rather not try to enumerate every possible primitive type as a constructor in a sum type.
But if I don't do that, then I'm not sure how to represent this situation in Koka.

The Koka book has a section about "extensible data types," which sounds like what I want.
Unfortunately, its entire contents are "Todo."
The grammar also mentions `open` and `extend` terms, which I imagine relate to said extensible data types, but I haven't seen any use of them.


## Standard library


### Documentation

The standard library's documentation is extremely thin.
Some modules have no documentation at all.
Most that do have a single sentence.

After partial type checking, I think thorough documentation on std would be one of the biggest wins for the writeability of Koka.
And fortunately, it's a much easier thing to do.


### The red-black tree

Red-black trees are a frequent subject of examples relating to Koka's garbage collection system, Perceus.
However, while it's provided (twice) as a sample, it isn't actually in std.
It'd be nice to have it there as well.

Actually, there are *no* polymorphic data structures that require operations over their elements.
That would be a good way to show how to use implicits in a more relevant context than the syntax examples.


### List and sslice

At least while code was in progress, I noticed that type inference *very* frequently failed to choose between list and sslice functions, even when chained on values that were explicitly annotated as lists.
Usually those errors went away as I progressed further through the function I was writing.
However, when combined with the lack of partial type checking, I either have to write the explicit qualification or fly blind for a bit.
As a proponent of autocomplete-oriented programming, the latter is an unpleasant situation for me

A similar situation arises with tuple accessors when the tuple arity is hidden behind parametric types.
One instance resisted correct inference through the completion of my hashmap module.


## Best practices

### `inline`

Another undocumented keyword is `inline`.
I spotted some uses of it in koka-community packages and tried tossing it around in my code.
But I'm not sure how the compiler treats functions marked inline.

There are a few things that manual inline markers might indicate to a compiler.
In C and C++, advanced compilers generally make their own inlining decisions, and the inline keyword mostly serves to require that the function body exist in the same compilation unit.
For the most part, that's the mental model I have for it, but I don't think that makes much sense in Koka.

Should I be using `inline` for small functions?
Should I be using it at all?


### `fip` and `fbip`

There are multiple papers about "functional but in-place" programming in Koka.
Part of supporting this are the `fip` and `fbip` keywords to force a function to be written in functional but in-place style.

Should I always be marking my functions as `fip` or `fbip` when possible?
Is there any downside, other than the restrictions it introduces?
Intuitively, it seems like it would infect the API: someone else's `fip` function that depends on mine breaks if I make mine no longer `fip`.

Even so, I haven't actually found an opportunity to use these markers.
Any use of an argument function or almost any effect seems to immediately preclude them.
Also any use of any std function, since none of them are so marked.

Also, I'm a bit surprised that they're function declaration markers and not just effects, in the language about effects.
I assume there's a reason for that.
The FPÂ² paper is still in my backlog, though.


### Tests

There are some instances of what appear to be automated tests in std and koka-community/std.
They import an undocumented std/test module (I learned after writing most of this report that this is itself in koka-community/std).

This is another place where I can probably answer my own questions with a bit of reading.
Some explicit guidance on testing, or at least documentation on std/test, would be very helpful, though.
And given the tests I glanced at, it seems like a lot is left to the programmer; a more formal framework would also be a major win.

I do wonder whether property-based testing is on anyone's roadmap.


### Vectors

Hashmaps require O(1) indexing of dynamically sized arrays, and it seems like the only way to get that in base Koka is with vectors.
However, I'm not familiar with the performance characteristics of vectors in functional programming languages.
If I'm copying the entire vector every time I update a bucket, then I can't provide O(1) insert.
And, notably, I did have to implement my own `replace` function to do this, so I suspect that's what's happening.

Of course, one of the major draws of Koka is the functional but in-place paradigm.
Does that work with vectors?
I think that would require that every cell of the vector be reference-counted separately, which doesn't sound like the obvious implementation.


### Implicits versus effects

It seems like the standard way to implement generic containers with operations on elements is to use implicits.
I'm accustomed to bounded parametric polymorphism, so it took me a while to find out about implicits (also not mentioned in the Koka book), but it wasn't hard to adjust to them.

Before I learned about implicits, I tried a different approach: a polymorphic effect.

```
effect hash<k>
  fun hash(key: k): int64
  fun eq(k1: k, k2: k): bool
```

I didn't finish the implementation using this approach, but it seemed like it would work fine.
So, I'm left to wonder whether one approach is really better than the other.
Other than possible performance considerations, I think the main difference is that the effect approach requires the user to specify handlers, whereas the implicit approach is, well, implicit.


## Editor integration


### Installation

I want to explicitly call out the installation process for Koka as something that is done overwhelmingly *right*.
It might be a VS Code benefit, but on all of Windows, WSL, and Linux proper, it's been just a matter of installing the extension, creating a Koka file, and clicking the "install everything" button that pops up.


### Auto-formatting

I've already seen about every variant I would expect for separating a bound name from its type annotation across Koka code I've seen.
Sometimes it's `name: type`, sometimes `name : type`, and occasionally even `name:type`.

After my experiences with other languages, I feel like I shouldn't be choosing which one of these I use.
An auto-formatter should be making this decision for me.

In particular, my favorite approach here is Go's:
"gofmt's style is no one's favorite, but gofmt is everyone's favorite."
I fully believe that it should be the *language* that chooses an idiomatic style, once, for everyone; an auto-formatter should not be configurable (unless it is for a very old language).

By coincidence, during the time I was writing this experience report today, [a corresponding issue](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka/issues/521) appeared.


### Inlay hints

One minorâ€¦ curiosity, not really a complaint.
Koka's VS Code integration hides inferred specializations by default, and reveals them while holding Ctrl+Alt.
This is actually *exactly the opposite* of a built-in VS Code setting:
`"editor.inlayHints.enabled": "onUnlessPressed"` shows inlay hints *except* when holding Ctrl+Alt.
That happens to be the setting I use, but it's not such a critical thing that the provided behavior is a problem for me.


### Language server output

A bit of annoyance is that the language server's logging in VS Code goes to a pseudo-terminal instead of an output window.


## The Koka book

The Koka book has several sections that are unhelpfully short, "todo," or even totally empty:

- 3.3.4. Matching
- 3.3.5. Extensible Data Types
- 3.3.6. Inductive, Co-inductive, and Recursive Types
- 3.4.9. Side-effect Isolation
- 3.4.12. Linear Effects
- 3.4.13 Named and Scoped Handlers

Pattern matching at least works how I expect from other languages, so it's mostly just a matter of syntax, which is easy to find in the core library.
I expect side-effect isolation is probably meant to be about the `run` function described in the row-polymorphic effects paper.
Some more explanation on the other topics would be helpful.

There is a ["hidden" docsite](https://koka-community.github.io/koka-docs/koka-docs.kk.html) in koka-community that fills out some of these sections, along with describing or mentioning a number of other topics I've mentioned in this report.
I noticed it when I first found koka-community, but it slipped my mind to check it.
Thanks to Tim Whiting for pointing me back to it (along with all your other work on Koka!).

Aside from these sections, there were a couple minor issues I noticed in the grammar appendices which I'm reporting here instead of in an issue due to laziness:

- A number of terms in the lexical grammar are typechecked as Koka, leading to some strange results.
- The link to the Haskell implementation of the layout seems like it points to the wrong line today.


## Overall

Despite all my complaining, Koka is absolutely a language I want to continue writing.
Programming with effects feels like a very natural way to view the programming concepts I'm familiar with.
Functional programming is always fun for me, and the escape hatch into procedural-style mutability can save a lot of thinky goop.

A lot of these points are places I will probably look into contributing myself.
